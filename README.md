#online film ticket booking system

#description :
This project includes an online film ticket booking system.
The film hall called Scope Cinema has two branches. This system has the ability to book tickets online for films being screened in both branches.
This system can be logged in by both a user and an admin.
This system has already been hard coded by an admin. That hard coded admin can register other admins.
A user can register as a user on the signup page.
When an admin logs into the system, they navigate to the relevant admin dashboard and are granted access to admin features.
Once logged into the system as a user, the user will be granted the right to book film tickets.
